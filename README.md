Try delta, everyone else has. 

My name is originial, as is my idea. 
Changes in technology are in  desperate need of uniform policies, and codes for ethical treatment of human civil rights, both in the States, and especially in the most poverty stricken countries with internet accessibility.  In keeping logic and a scientific method at the core of what I and all others would like to propose, would serve to protect us essentially from ourselvez.  America does have unique issues which may be adressed first, to make it great, no to keep in the patriotic, and not patriot act stride.  Left to mere manipulation for personal gain, and even left to all the dedicated and logically sound hackers, developers, etc., we are exposing ourselves without having safeguards beside clever automations, which can also learn bias as again, humans are generally opportunistically and inadvertently dumb by nature at any given moment.  

Just like walking can be a controlled fall, perhaps a mindful, exclusively written for and by those industry that have bills, gates, but no money to fund BLM and Police state political tactics, our world can change in a positive way and still avoid the hangups of a beauracy.  

Thsnks for reading, and hope to help make this happen for the real people, not legislators alone.
